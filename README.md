💼 CodSoft Internship Projects Welcome to my project repository completed during my internship at CodSoft. This collection includes three key projects that demonstrate my skills in rule-based logic, game AI, and recommendation systems.

✅ 1. Rule-Based Chatbot 📌 Overview A simple chatbot that responds to user input based on predefined rules. It uses basic natural language processing and control structures to simulate a conversational experience.

🛠️ Technologies Used Python

Regular Expressions

📋 Key Features Handles greetings and basic user queries

Uses if-else logic and pattern matching

Easily extendable with new conversation rules

🎮 2. Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Minimax Algorithm) 📌 Overview A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring an unbeatable AI opponent. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to determine optimal moves, ensuring it never loses.

🛠️ Technologies Used Python

Minimax Algorithm

Game Theory Concepts

📋 Key Features Human vs AI gameplay

Intelligent decision-making using Minimax

Expandable with Alpha-Beta Pruning for performance optimization

🎯 3. Simple Recommendation System 📌 Overview A basic recommendation system that suggests items such as movies or books based on user preferences. It utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques.

🛠️ Technologies Used Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

CSV-based Datasets

📋 Key Features Personalized item recommendations

Uses similarity metrics to find relevant suggestions

Modular and adaptable to different datasets

🏁 Conclusion These projects provided practical experience in:
